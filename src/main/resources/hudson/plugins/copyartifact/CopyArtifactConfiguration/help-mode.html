How Copy Artifact checks permissions to access artifacts to copy:
<dl>
  <dt>Production</dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>RECOMMENDED.</strong>
      <p>
      Performs permission checks while running builds.
      Builds copying artifacts from another builds (source builds)
      require appropriate permission configurations
      unless source builds are allowed to read from any users.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can configure "Permission to Copy Artifact" in
      jobs to copy artifacts from. It configures jobs allowed to
      copy artifacts from that job.
      You can configure that with <code>copyArtifactPermission</code>
      in pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can configure "Access Control for Builds"
      in Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security
      so that builds run with authentication allowed
      to access source builds.
      That configuration is shown only when plugins providing
      "Access Control for Builds" are installed.
      See those plugin documentations for details.
      </p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Migration</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Performs permission checks when configuring jobs
      or when running builds if the name of the source job is
      configured with variables.
      This is the behavior compatible to Copy Artifact 1.43.1 or earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
      This may cause security vulnerabilities allowing malicious users
      to bypass permission checks.
      This mode is provided only to allow users to upgrade job configurations
      and migrate to Production mode easily.
      You should migrate to Production mode as soon as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
      Build executions that would fail in Production mode are
      recorded and displayed as warnings to administrators.
      Administrators should check those warnings
      and update the job configurations to successfully use Production mode.
      You can see more details about how to update the job configurations
      in the "Production" section
      and the page linked from the warning messages.
