title=Copy Artifact migration helper
contextMessage=The projects listed in this page copied artifacts from projects \
  where they don't have appropriate permissions while building. \
  They will fail in Production mode, and their configuration should be updated \
  before you switch Copy Artifact to Production mode. \
  See Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security for more details \
  about Production mode and Migration mode. \
  This list is updated every time such projects are built in your instance \
  while Copy Artifact is set to Migration mode.
